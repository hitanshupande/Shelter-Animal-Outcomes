# Shelter-Animal-Outcomes
Kaggle Competition for predicting outcomes of shelter animals

Using the dataset provided by Kaggle, the objective was to predict the outcome of animals in the shelter. Features included animal type, color, breed, sex, neutered or not, etc.

I used Random Forest Classifier to train the model and perfomed some feature engineering to obtain reliable results.
